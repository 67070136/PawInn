# PawInn API agreement

This is the team's starting contract, not a list of implemented endpoints. Confirm it together before coding. If an endpoint changes, update this file and tell its consumers.

## Shared conventions

- JSON request/response bodies; camelCase field names.
- Database IDs are generated INTEGER primary keys. Serialize them as opaque strings at the HTTP boundary; validate/convert incoming IDs before parameterized queries.
- Dates: `YYYY-MM-DD`. Timestamps: ISO 8601. Check-out must be after check-in.
- Currency: THB. Store database money as exact decimal values or integer satang; never trust a total sent by the browser.
- Proposed authentication: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Account owns token issuance; each service validates it and enforces roles/ownership.
- Success: `{"data": ...}`. Error: `{"message": "A useful explanation"}`.
- Use 201 for creation; 200 for normal success; 204 for successful deletion; 400 invalid input; 401 unauthenticated; 403 forbidden; 404 missing; 409 conflicting state.
- Each service exposes `GET /health`.
- All three services connect to the shared `pawinn` database. The SQL already defines matching integer PK/FK types across all seven tables; API IDs remain strings at the HTTP boundary.
- Services primarily write their own tables. Shared reads/joins are allowed for ownership, availability and prices; internal HTTP lookups are optional rather than required.
- Keep these shapes independent of frontend demo storage; Member 1 adapts API responses to page state.

## Member 2: account

| Method/path | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| POST /api/auth/register | Accept name, email, password and optional phone; create CUSTOMER only; return token and public user |
| POST /api/auth/login | Accept email/password; return token and public user |
| GET /api/users/me | Return the signed-in user |
| GET /api/pets | Return the customer's pets |
| GET /api/pets/:id | Return an owned pet; booking can verify ownership directly against the shared pets table |
| POST /api/pets | Create an owned pet |
| PATCH /api/pets/:id | Update an owned pet |
| DELETE /api/pets/:id | Delete an owned pet only when no booking references it; preserve booking history |

Public user: `{id, name, email, phone, role}`; never return password hashes.
Pet: `{id, ownerId, name, species, breed, birthDate, notes}`.
Roles: CUSTOMER, STAFF. Species: Dog, Cat.
Seed a staff account; registration must not accept a caller-selected STAFF role.
Account and booking owners coordinate pets/bookings foreign keys and active-booking checks before changing a booked pet's species. A normal FK prevents deleting a referenced pet; reject that deletion rather than cascading away booking history.

## Member 3: room

| Method/path | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| GET /api/room-types | Return descriptions, compatible species and base prices |
| GET /api/rooms | Return room inventory; support optional roomTypeId and active filters |
| PATCH /api/rooms/:id | Staff changes active/inactive status |

Room type: `{id, name, description, species, pricePerNight}`.
Room: `{id, roomTypeId, roomNumber, isActive}`.
Start with seed SQL for inventory; add more management endpoints only if the team needs them.
Define what happens to existing reservations before allowing an occupied/reserved room to be deactivated. All three types share the agreed inventory target of five physical rooms each (15 total).

## Member 4: booking

| Method/path | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| GET /api/availability?start=...&end=... | Return `[{roomTypeId, available}]`; optionally filter species |
| POST /api/bookings | Accept petId, roomTypeId, start, end; choose an available physical room and calculate the price |
| GET /api/bookings | Customers see their own; staff can see all; support optional petId/status filters |
| GET /api/bookings/:id | Return an owned booking, or any booking for staff, including timeline and cancellation state |
| POST /api/bookings/:id/checkout | Accept outcome SUCCESS or FAILED and a payment attempt ID; simulate payment, safely handle retries |
| POST /api/bookings/:id/cancellations | Accept reason; create a customer request for an eligible booking |
| GET /api/cancellations | Staff lists requests; support optional status filter |
| PATCH /api/cancellations/:id | Staff submits decision APPROVED or DECLINED plus notes |
| PATCH /api/bookings/:id/complete | Staff completes an eligible stay after check-out |

Booking response: `{id, userId, petId, roomId, roomTypeId, start, end, nightlyRate, total, status, paymentStatus, refundStatus, createdAt}`; detail includes logs and cancellation information.
Booking statuses: PENDING, CONFIRMED, CANCELLED, COMPLETED.
Payment statuses: UNPAID, SUCCESS, FAILED.
Cancellation statuses: PENDING, APPROVED, DECLINED.
Refund statuses: NOT_REQUESTED, PENDING, SUCCESS, FAILED.

Pending reservations hold inventory for 15 minutes, then expire to CANCELLED if unpaid. Reject overlapping bookings for a room or pet. Failed payment can be retried before expiry. Repeated successful checkout/review must not charge/refund twice. Approved cancellation records a full mock refund for a paid booking and releases the room; declined requests keep it confirmed.

## Database mapping and fixtures

The schema and demo data are implemented under `database/`; run the [database setup guide](../database/README.md). SQL uses snake_case; APIs keep the camelCase shapes above. Map `user_id` to user `id`, `full_name` to `name`, `care_notes` to `notes`, and booking `check_in_date`/`check_out_date`/`total_price` to `start`/`end`/`total`. Obtain a booking's `roomTypeId` by joining rooms. Never return password hashes.

The sample accounts use public demo password `PawInnDemo123!`, stored as bcrypt hashes. The Account owner must implement password comparison. Booking hold expiry is derived from `created_at + 15 minutes`; cancel expired unpaid PENDING rows before they continue blocking availability. SQL does not run the expiry job automatically.

## First integration example

A customer signs in, loads their pets, browses room types, asks booking for availability, creates a reservation, completes mock checkout and reads booking history. Then the customer requests cancellation and staff reviews it.

Decide exact optional detail fields and example responses together before wiring the frontend. Every owner should add one real request/response example here when their first endpoint works.
